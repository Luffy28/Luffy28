# 👋 Hi, I'm Lutfiyah!

🎓 Computer Engineering student at the University of Florida  
🤖 Passionate about Machine Learning, AI, and Hardware Systems  
💡 Aspiring AI/ML Engineer with an interest in ethical and medical tech  

I’m driven by curiosity and the challenge of building smart systems that have real-world impact. I love learning by doing—whether that’s through internships, personal exploration, or collaborative projects. Recently, I’ve been diving deeper into machine learning and AI with a focus on responsible design and practical implementation.

💬 Ask me about my experience as a Break Through Tech AI Fellow!  
Through the fellowship, I’ve been exploring applied machine learning and building technical solutions with:  
**🧠 Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab

I’m looking to grow through opportunities that blend intelligence with systems—whether it’s applied AI, robotics, or cloud-based platforms. Open to internships, research, or any chance to learn from great teams doing meaningful work. Let’s connect!

## ✨ Fun Fact:
I'm a hands-on kind of girl—I love to tinker, build, and figure out how things work from the inside out. Whether I’m wiring hardware or debugging code, I’m in my element when I’m creating something from scratch. You’ll usually find me doing it all with a lo-fi playlist in the background, a K-drama playing on the side, or rewatching my favorite anime (because yes, multitasking is a lifestyle).
